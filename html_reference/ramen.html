  <h1>Components of ramen</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Noodles</h2>

      <p>
        Ramen <b>noodles</b> are <u>made by adding water and carbonated water to flour and 
        kneading them to make dough</u> - then thinly rolling the dough and cutting it. 
        Other ingredients such as eggs are also used. The quality of noodles 
        varies depending on the type of flour, the rate the water is added, the 
        thickness of the dough, the thickness and shape of the cut, and the degree 
        of noodle aging.
      </p>
    <h2>Tare</h2>

                <p>
        <b>Tare</b> is the <u>seasoning for ramen soup</u>. Tare is classified into three types: 
        <i>shoyu</i> (soy sauce) tare, <i>shio</i> (salt) tare, and <i>miso</i> tare. 
        Tare isn’t used just to add saltiness but to also increase flavor. It’s often 
        made by extracting and condensing umami from various ingredients- particularly 
        kombu kelp which is rich in glutamic acid. The tare is prepared separately 
        from the broth and combined with the broth in the bowl.
      </p>
    <h2>Broth</h2>

      <p>
        A finished ramen <b>broth</b> is basically a combination of soup, tare (sauce) 
        and fats and oil. The soup is created by <u>boiling ingredients in water 
          where umami and flavor are transferred</u>. The soup is only seasoned once 
        it’s mixed with the tare during the cooking process. The most popular 
        broth styles include <i>tonkotsu</i> (pork bone), chicken and seafood soup.
      </p>
    <h2>Toppings</h2>

      <p>
        Popular <b>toppings</b> include <i>chashu</i>, <i>menma</i>, <i>nori</i>, wood ear 
        mushrooms, green onion, egg and so on. In most cases, the toppings are 
        <u>cooked separately and cut and placed on top of the noodles right before 
        serving</u>.
      </p>
    <h2>Aroma oil</h2>
      <img src="https://prohomecooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/f7c207_f8fffcada88f4de3bdc4a0b4bc82eb28mv2-1024x683.jpeg" alt="ramen aroma oil" width="300px"/>
      <p>
        The <b>aroma oil</b> is <u>most often added to the bottom of the bowl at the same 
        time as the tare</u>; before the broth is poured in. The oil does not emulsify 
        with the broth but instead rises to the top of the bowl and forms bubbles 
        that float above the soup. These droplets of oil attach themselves to the 
        noodles as they are pulled from the soup and sit atop the broth as it’s 
        sipped from the spoon – adding pleasant aromas to every slurp.
